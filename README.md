# Simple Bash Script That Starts My Workflow

This is a simple Bash script that makes my workflow easier, as a developer who is constantly learning new things.

So far what the script does is -

- Opens vsCode with the project specified.
- Opens the link to the youtube tutorial,
- Link to the project github and link to my github where my project is pushed.

The script can be improved, hence suggestions would be appreciated. For now this works for me, but I will improve it further depending on the changes to my workflow.
